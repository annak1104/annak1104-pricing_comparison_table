Task: Create a Complex Responsive Pricing Comparison Table

Description:

Your task is to design and implement a complex responsive pricing comparison table using HTML, CSS, and SASS. The comparison table should showcase different features for various subscription plans and adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.

Requirements:

Design a pricing comparison table that includes three subscription plans: Basic, Standard, and Premium.
Each subscription plan should display the following information:
Plan name and type (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium).
Monthly price and billing frequency (e.g., "$9.99/month" or "$99.99/year").
List of features included in the plan. Each feature should have a checkmark (✔) or cross (✘) to indicate availability.
A "Sign Up" button for each plan.
Implement a toggle that allows users to switch between monthly and yearly billing. Prices and billing frequency should update accordingly.
Design the table with a modern and visually appealing layout.
Use a color scheme that complements the overall theme.
Style the buttons, features, and table header distinctly.
Apply hover effects on plan buttons.
Utilize SASS for styling and organization of your CSS code. Implement variables, mixins, and nesting effectively.
Ensure the table is responsive for various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop):
On mobile, the table should stack the plan information vertically for easy readability.
On tablet, the table should display side by side for plans, and features should remain readable.
On desktop, the table should have a comfortable width, and all information should be presented neatly.

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

HTML Structure: Is the HTML well-structured and semantically meaningful?

CSS and SASS: Is the styling intricate and polished, and does SASS usage demonstrate proficiency?

Responsiveness: Does the comparison table adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes?

Toggle Functionality: Does the billing frequency toggle work as expected?

Design Aesthetics: Is the comparison table visually pleasing, with a coherent design?

Complexity Handling: How well does the code manage the complexity of the design and responsive behavior?

Submission:
